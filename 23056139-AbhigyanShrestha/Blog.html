                    <h2>Negative Impact</h2>
                    <p>With features like automated inventory management, online ordering, and self-checkout kiosks, technology has definitely transformed the grocery store experience. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to this digital revolution as well. The possibility of employment losses as a result of automation is one major disadvantage. Human labour may be displaced when additional functions, like stocking and checkout, become computerised. For those who depend on these jobs to support themselves and their family, this may result in unemployment and financial difficulty. Furthermore, depending too much on technology exposes businesses to risks like cyberattacks and system failures that could interrupt business operations and jeopardise customer data. Furthermore, the longer screen times connected to online shopping could lead to sedentary habits and less social engagement, which would affect both physical and mental health.</p>

                    <h2>How Technology has affected daily life and business while selling?</h2>
                    <p>Technology has changed how we buy and sell goods and services, having a significant impact on both daily life and companies in the selling industry.Technology has significantly improved the accessibility and convenience of buying in daily life.The advent of e-commerce platforms and smartphone apps has made it unnecessary for customers to visit physical stores because they can now explore and buy things from the comfort of their homes or while they're on the go. A change in customer behaviour has resulted from this convenience, as more individuals choose internet purchasing over traditional brick-and-mortar retail.
                        Technology has also made it possible for companies to connect with a worldwide audience, eradicating regional boundaries and broadening their market reach.By utilising digital marketing techniques including email campaigns, social media advertising, and SEO.
                        Though technology has greatly benefited the selling industry, there are drawbacks and disruptions as well. The competition from internet giants such as Amazon may prove too strong for traditional shops, resulting in store closures and job losses. Furthermore, because technology is advancing so quickly, companies must constantly adapt and make time- and money-consuming investments in new infrastructure and tools.</p>
